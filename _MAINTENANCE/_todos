digital ocean is unergoing maintenance: 
I createdd an ssh key in Bitbucket , and I got the 'finger print' for my digital ocean droplet. 
I didn't get it to work as expected and started looking into whether or not to 'white list' the 
bitbucket IP addressed on by Droplet...then I found that maintenance was happening.
