 1: ssh 
 Here:  i added the ssh key generated on bitbucket settings to my local ssh and successfully used it to ssh in to droplet.
  ssh -i ~/.ssh/pipeline_ssh_key root@157.245.216.183

I added same key to droplet under .ssh/ 
bayonforte_pipeline_key.pub


SO...this should work from yaml.
ssh -i ~/.ssh/bayonforte_pipeline_key root@157.245.216.183

Permission Denied Public Key MEANS that SSH IS ! set up and permission is the issue.

Now I added the key to the repo right next to the yaml file.
I THINK this would work.
ssh -i bayonforte_pipeline_key root@157.245.216.183

Enter file in which to save the key (/root/.ssh/id_rsa): /root/.ssh/droplet_key
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase): 
Enter same passphrase again: 
Your identification has been saved in /root/.ssh/droplet_key.
Your public key has been saved in /root/.ssh/droplet_key.pub.

BITBUCKET put my own private and public SSH key generated on the droplet.
bibucket stores private here.
~/.ssh/config.
We make sure that the public is here on our droplet.
~/.ssh/authorized_keys
both are now true.


SCRIPT for ssh to include in my bitbucket-pipelines.yml file when it is ready.
script:
  - pipe: atlassian/rsync-deploy:0.4.0
    variables:
      USER: 'ec2-user'
      SERVER: '127.0.0.1'
      REMOTE_PATH: '/var/www/build/'
      LOCAL_PATH: 'public'


SUCCESS: 
root@docker-s-1vcpu-1gb-nyc3-01:/var/www/build# ls
nothing_yet.txt  public
root@docker-s-1vcpu-1gb-nyc3-01:/var/www/build# cd public/
root@docker-s-1vcpu-1gb-nyc3-01:/var/www/build/public# ls
favicon.ico  index.html  manifest.json
root@docker-s-1vcpu-1gb-nyc3-01:/var/www/build/public# 


so, I've got it working to some extent but I do not have a seemless deployiment process.
